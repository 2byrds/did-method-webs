<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>DID methods answer many questions. Two noteworthy ones are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>How is information about DIDs and DID docs published and discovered?</li>
    <li>How is the trustworthiness of this information evaluated?</li>
</ul>
<p>
    The previously released <code>did:web</code> method merges these two questions, giving one answer: <em>
    Information is published and secured using familiar web mechanisms</em>. This has
    wonderful adoption benefits, because the processes and tooling are familiar to millions
    of developers.
</p>
<p>
    Unfortunately, that answer works better for the first question than the second. The current
    web is simply not very trustworthy. Websites get hacked. Sysadmins are sometimes malicious.
    DNS can be hijacked. X509 certs often prove less than clients wish. Browser validation checks are
    imperfect. Different certificate authorities have different quality standards. The processes
    that browser vendors use to pre-approve certificate authorities in browsers are opaque and
    centralized. TLS is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks on intranets with customized
    certificate chains. Governance is weak and inconsistent...
</p>
<p>
    Furthermore, familiar web mechanisms are almost always operated by corporate IT staff.
    This makes them an awkward fit for the ideal of decentralized autonomy &mdash; even if
    individuals can publish a DID on IT's web servers, those individuals are at the mercy
    of IT for their security.
</p>
<p>
    The <code>did:webs</code> method described in this spec separates these two questions, and
    gives them different answers. <em>Information about DIDs</em> is still published on the web,
    but <em>its trustworthiness</em> derives from mechanisms entirely governed by individual
    DID controllers. This preserves most of the delightful convenience of <code>did:web</code>,
    while drastically upgrading security and decentralized trust.
