<h2>Security Considerations</h2>
<p>
    Perfect protection from eavesdropping is not possible with HTTPS, for various reasons.
    However, DDURLs SHOULD be hosted in a way that embodies accepted cybersecurity best
    practice. This is not strictly necessary to guarantee the authenticity of the
    data. However, it safeguards privacy, discourages denial of service, accords with a
    defense-in-depth mindset, aids regulatory compliance, and makes it easier to troubleshoot.
    How a DDURL is hosted should let clients fetch a DID doc and a KEL with roughly
    the same confidence that's associated with properly implemented online banking).
</p>
<p>
    The common name in the SSL/TLS certificate from the server MUST correspond to the
    way the server is referenced in the URL. This means that if the URL includes <code>
    www.example.com</code>, the common name in the SSL/TLS certificate must be <code>
    www.example.com</code> as well. Unlike <code>did:web</code>, the URL MAY use an IP
    address instead. If it does, then the common name in the certificate must be the IP
    address as well. Essentially, the URL and the certificate MUST NOT identify the server
    in contradictory ways; subject to that constraint, how the server is identified is
    flexible.
</p>
<p>
    The server certificate MAY be self-issued, or it MAY chain back to an unknown certificate
    authority. However, to ensure reasonable security hygiene, it MUST be valid. This has
    two meanings, both of which are required:
    </p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The certificate MUST satisfy whatever requirements are active in the client, such
        that the client does accept the certificate and use it to build and communicate over
        the encrypted HTTPS session where a DID doc and KEL are fetched.
    </li>
    <li>
        The certificate MUST pass some common-sense validity tests, even if the client is very
        permissive: It MUST have a valid signature, it MUST NOT be expired or revoked or
        deny-listed, and it MUST NOT have any broken links in its chain of trust.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    If a DDURL results in a redirect, each URL MUST satisfy the same security requirements.
    A DDURL MAY come from a URL shortener.
