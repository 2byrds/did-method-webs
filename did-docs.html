<h2>DID docs</h2>

<p>
    DID docs in this method are generated or derived from the key state of the
    corresponding AID. If the AID in question is <a>non-transferrable</a>, then
    the DID doc is generated algorithmically from the DID value itself, and
    nothing else. If the AID is <a>transferrable</a>, then the <a>KEL</a> and
    the <a>TEL</a> are also required inputs to the generation algorithm.
</p>

<p>
    DID docs are processable as pure JSON. Parties who wish to process them as
    JSON-LD can do so by referencing <a href="https://example.com/context">this @context</a>.
</p>

<p>
    The algorithm for transforming an AID to a DID doc begins with the same algorithm
    as the did:key method. TODO: add info from TEL for service endpoints and
    other keys.
</p>

<p>
    Hashes, cryptographic keys, and signatures are represented as CESR strings. This is an
    approach similar to multibase, making them self-describing and terse.
