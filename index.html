    <p>
        This document specifies a <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/#specific-did-method-schemes"
        target="didspec">DID Method</a>, <code>did:webs</code>, that is web-based but also highly and
        innovatively secure. Like its predecessor, <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/">
        <code>did:web</code></a>, the <code>did:webs</code> method uses websites and popular, mature
        tooling to publish DIDs and make them discoverable. Unlike <code>did:web</code>, this method's
        trust is not rooted in DNS, webmasters, X509, and certificate authorities. Instead, it derives
        from meticulous usage of cryptographic keys by those who control identifiers.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <code>did:webs</code> method does not need blockchains for trust. However, it can reference
        arbitrary blockchains as an extra, optional publication mechanism. This offers an interoperability
        bridge from (or between) blockchain ecosystems. Also, without directly supporting environments
        where the web is not practical (e.g., IOT, Lo-Ra, BlueTooth, NFC), the method builds on
        a foundation that fully supports those environments, making future interop of identifiers
        between web and non-web an easy step.
    </p>
    <p>
        All DID methods make tradeoffs. The ones in <code>did:webs</code> result in a method that is
        cheap, easy to implement, and scalable. No exotic or unproven cryptography is required.
        Deployment is trivial. Cryptographic trust is strongly decentralized, and governance is
        transparent. Regulatory quandaries vanish. Any tech community or legal jurisdiction can use it.
        However, <code>did:webs</code> <em>does</em> depend on the web for publication and discovery.
        This may color its decentralization and privacy. It adds a new component to the tech stack,
        imposing a modest learning curve as a result. For users, the method also raises the bar of
        accountability, thoughtfulness, and autonomy; this can be viewed as either a drawback or a
        benefit (or both).
