    <p>
        This document specifies a <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/#specific-did-method-schemes"
        target="didspec">DID Method</a>, <code>did:webs</code>, that is both web-based and highly secure.
        Like its predecessor, <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/"><code>did:web</code></a>,
        the <code>did:webs</code> method uses websites and ubiquitous, mature tooling to publish DIDs and make
        them discoverable. Unlike <code>did:web</code>, this method's trust is not rooted in DNS, webmasters,
        X509, and certificate authorities.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <code>did:webs</code> method does not need blockchains for trust; conceptually, its closest
        cousins are <code>did:key</code> and <code>did:peer</code>. However, it can use arbitrary blockchains
        as an extra, optional publication mechanism. This creates an interoperability bridge from (or
        between) blockchain ecosystems. The method is cheap, easy to implement, and scalable. However, it
        is not particularly private, and it doesn't work if parties can't use web technology. It strongly
        decentralizes cryptographic trust, but only weakly decentralizes publication and discovery.
