## Core Characteristics

### Method Name

1. The method name that identifies this DID method SHALL be: `webs`.
1. A DID that uses this method MUST begin with the following prefix: `did:webs:`.
1. Per the DID specification, this string MUST be lower case.
1. The remainder of the DID, after the prefix, is the case-sensitive [[ref: method-specific identifier]]
([[ref: MSI]]) described [below](#method-specific-identifier).

> Note: when pronounced aloud, “webs” SHOULD become two syllables: the word “web” and the letter “s” (which stands for “secure”). Separating the final letter this way emphasizes that the method offers a security upgrade surpassing the one HTTPS gives to HTTP.

### Method-Specific Identifier

1. The `did:webs` [[ref: method-specific identifier]] has two
parts, a [[ref: host]] with an optional path (identical to
`did:web`), plus a KERI AID (autonomic identifier) that is always the final
component of the path.
1. The [[ref: ABNF]] definition of a `did:webs` DID is as follows:

    ```abnf
    webs-did = "did:webs:" host [pct-encoded-colon port] *(":" path) ":" aid

    ; 'host' as defined in RFC 1035 and RFC 1123
    host = *( ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "." )  ; Simplified representation, actual RFCs
                                          ; have more complex rules for domains and IP addresses.
                                          ; IN ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATIONS REPLACE WITH A MATURE 
                                          ; HOST PARSING LIBRARY.

    ; 'pct-encoded-colon' represents a percent-encoded colon
    pct-encoded-colon = "%3A" / "%3a"  ; Percent encoding for ':'

    ; 'port' number (simplified version)
    port = 1*5(DIGIT)

    ; 'path' definition
    path = 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "_" / "~" / "." / "/")

    ; 'aid' as base64 encoded value
    aid = 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT / "+" / "/" / "=") ; Base64 characters

    ; ALPHA, DIGIT are standard ABNF primitives for alphabetic and numeric characters
    ```

1. The formal rules describing valid [[ref: host]] syntax are described in [RFC1035], [RFC1123], and [RFC2181].
1. A port MAY be included and the colon MUST be percent encoded, like `%3a`, to prevent a conflict with paths.
1. Directories and subdirectories MAY optionally be included, delimited by colons rather than slashes.

1. The KERI AID is a unique identifier and MUST be derived from the inception event of a KERI identifier.

> The inception event is the first item in the identifier's [[ref: KEL]]. The algorithm used to generate the AID depends on the type of AID. If the AID is transferable (supports key rotation) then the AID is generated by taking a cryptographic digest of the inception event of the KEL of the AID. If the AID is non-transferable (does not support key rotation) the AID is generated by taking a cryptographic digest of the first (and only) public key of the identifier. See the [[ref: KERI Fundamentals]] section for more details.

> After the [[ref: host]] and optional path in a `did:webs` is a final path component, a colon and the AID. To be compatible with `did:web`, the AID is "just a path", the final (and perhaps only) path element. The presence of the required AID as a path element means that a `did:webs` always has a path,and so the "no path" version of a `did:web` that implicitly uses the `.well-known` folder is not supported by `did:webs`. Any `did:webs` can be expressed as a `did:web` but the inverse is not true--a `did:webs` MUST include an AID.

### Target System(s)
1. As with `did:web`, `did:webs` MUST read data from whatever web server is referenced when the [[ref: host]] portion of one of its DID is resolved.
1. A `did:webs` DID MUST resolve to a [[ref: DID document]] using a simple text transformation to an HTTPS URL in the same way as a `did:web` DID.
1. A `did:web` DID and `did:webs` DID with the same [[ref: method-specific identifier]] will return the same
DID document, except for minor differences in the `id`, `controller`, and `alsoKnownAs` top-level properties that pertain to the identifiers themselves.
1. As with `did:web`, the location of the [[ref: DID document]] MUST be determined by transforming the DID to an HTTPS URL as follows:
    1. Replace `did:webs` with `https://`
    1. Replace the "`:`"s in the method-specific identifier with path separators, "'/'"s
    1. Convert the optional port percent encoding ("`%3A`"`) to a colon if present.
    1. Append "`/did.json`" to the resulting string.
1. A GET on that URL MUST return the DID document.
1. The location of the [[ref: KERI event stream]] is determined by transforming the previous URL as follows:
    1. Replace the trailing "`/did.json`" with "`/keri.cesr`".
    1. A GET on that URL MUST return the [[ref: KERI event stream]] for the AID in the `did:webs` identifier.
    1. The [[ref: KERI event stream]] MUST be [[ref: CESR]]-formatted (media type of application/cesr) and the KERI events must be verifiable using the KERI rules.
1. The `did:web` version of the DIDs are the same (minus the `s`) and point to the same `did.json` file, but have no knowledge of the `keri.cesr` file.

> The set of KERI features needed for most `did:webs` use cases is modest, with limited dependencies. These basics are summarized in the [KERI Fundamentals](#keri-fundamentals) section of this specification. This specification assumes a working knowledge of the concepts there. The inclusion of KERI in `did:webs` enables a number of capabilities for securing a `did:webs` identifier, including multi-signature support and the creation of [[ref: pre-rotated]] keys to prevent loss of control of the identifier if the current private key were to be compromised.

> A target system cannot forge or tamper with data protected by KERI, and if it deliberately serves an outdated copy, the duplicity is often detectable. Thus, any given target system in isolation can be viewed by this method as a dumb, untrusted server of content. It is the combination of target systems and some KERI mechanisms, _together_, that constitutes this method's verifiable data registry. In short, verifying the DID document by processing the [[ref: KERI event stream]] using KERI puts the "s" of "security" in `did:webs`.

```


### AID controlled identifiers
This section is non-normative.


> Since an AID is a unique cryptographic identifier that is inseparably bound to the [[ref: KERI event stream]] it is associated with, any AIDs and any `did:webs` DIDs that have the same AID component have the same controller(s). [[ref: AID controlled identifiers]] may vary in how quickly they reflect the current identity information, DID document and [[ref: KERI event stream]]. Notably, as defined in section [Identifiers in a `did:webs` DID document](#identifiers-in-a-didwebs-did-document), the `id` property in the DID document will differ based on the web location of the DID document. As well, different versions of the DID document and [[ref: KERI event stream]] may reside in different locations depending on the replication capabilities of the controlling entity. If the [[ref: KERI event streams]] differ for `did:webs` DIDs with the same AID, the smaller [[ref: KERI event stream]] MUST be a prefix of the larger [[ref: KERI event stream]] (e.g., the only difference in the [[ref: KERI event streams]] being the extra events in one of the [[ref: KERI event streams]], not yet reflected in the other). If the [[ref: KERI event streams]] diverge from one other (e.g., one is not a subset of the other), both the [[ref: KERI event streams]] and the DIDs MUST be considered invalid.

> The web supports a number of ways to redirect users. See the section on [Handling Web Redirections](#handling-web-redirection) later in this specification.

> KERI anticipates the possibility of a duplicitous actor with an AID that forks a [[ref: KERI event stream]] and shares different versions of the [[ref: KERI event stream]] containing different events, such as publishing different versions of the [[ref: KERI event stream]] on different web servers. The verification of the [[ref: KERI event stream]] MAY provide mechanisms for detecting such behavior, such as KERI witnesses and watchers.

### Handling Web Redirection

1. A `did:webs` MAY be a "stable" (long-lasting) identifier that can be put into documents such as verifiable credentials, to be useful for a very long time -- generations.
1. When a `did:webs` is updated for another location:
    1. Its AID MUST not change.
    1. The same [[ref: KERI event stream]] MUST be used to verify the DID document, with the only change being the designated aliases list reflecting the new location identifier.
    1. If a resolver can find a newly named DID that uses the same AID, and the [[ref: KERI event stream]] verifies the DID, then they have resolved the DID. 

The following reslution paths that `did:webs` identfiers SHALL leverage to help in the face of resolution uncertainty:
1. The `did:webs` DID SHALL provide other [[ref: designated aliases]] DID(s) that are anchored to the [[ref: KERI event stream]].
1. When a `did:webs` is permanently moved to some other location the resolver MAY redirect to any other `equivalentId` [[ref: designated aliases]].
    1. The `id` in the DID document MUST be set to the new location.
    1. An `equivalentId` entry of the old location SHOULD remain for historical purposes and anchored to the [[ref: KERI event stream]] using [[ref: designated aliases]]. See section [Use of `equivalentId`](#use-of-equivalentid) for more details.
    1. If possible, the controller of the DID MAY use web redirects to allow resolution of the old location of the DID to the new location.

> The web is not a very stable place, and documents are moved around and copied frequently. When two or more companies merge, often the web presence of some of the merged entities "disappears". It may not be possible to retain a permanent `did:webs` web location.

> The purpose of the history of [[ref: designated aliases]] for the AID is so that if the `did:webs` DID has been put in long-lasting documents, and its URL instantiation is redirected or disappears, the controller can explicitly indicate that the new DID is an `equivalentId` to the old one.

> If the previously published location of a `did:webs` is not redirected, an entity trying to resolve the DID MAY be able to find the data for the DID somewhere else using just the AID. Since the AID is globally unique and
references the same identifier, regardless of the rest of the string that is the full `did:webs`, web searching could yield either the current location of the DID document, or a copy of the DID that may be useful. For example, even the [Internet Archive: Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web) could be used to find a copy of the DID document and the [[ref: KERI event stream]] at some point in the past that may be sufficient for the purposes of the entity trying to resolve the DID. This specification does not rely on the Wayback Machine, but it might be a useful `did:webs` discovery tool.

> The DID document, [[ref: KERI event stream]] and other files related to a DID may be copied to other web locations. For example, someone might want to keep a cache of DIDs they use, or an entity might want to run a registry of "useful" DIDs for a cooperating group. While the combination of DID document and [[ref: KERI event stream]] make the DID and DID document verifiable, just as when published in their "intended" location, the absence of the `did:webs` in the [[ref: designated aliases]] for those locations in the DID document `equivalentId` means that the controller of the DID is not self-asserting any sort of tie between the DID and the location to which the DID-related documents have been copied. In contrast, if the controller confirms the link between the source and the copy with an `equivalentId`, the related copies will have to be kept in sync.

> Were the AID of a `did:webs` identifier to change, it would be an altogether new DID, unconnected to the first DID.

> A `did:webs` could be moved to use another DID method that uses the AID for uniqueness and the [[ref: KERI event stream]] for validity, but that is beyond the scope of this specification.

### DID Method Operations

#### Create

Creating a `did:webs` DID involves the following steps:
1. Choose the web URL where the DID document for the DID will be published, excluding the last element that will be the AID, once defined.
1. Create a KERI AID and add it as the last element of the web URL for the DID.
1. Add the appropriate KERI events to the AID's KERI logs that will correspond to properties of the DID document, such as verification methods and service endpoints.
1. Derive the `did:webs` [[ref: DID document]] by processing the [[ref: KERI event stream]] according to section [DID Document from KERI Events](#did-document-from-keri-events).
1. For compatibility reasons, transform the derived `did:webs` DID document to the corresponding `did:web` DID document according to section [Transformation to did:web DID Document](#transformation-to-didweb-did-document).
1. Create the AID folder on the web server at the selected location, and place the `did:web` DID document resource (`did.json`) and the [[ref: KERI event stream]] resource (`keri.cesr`) into that folder. See section [Target System(s)](#target-systems) for further details about the locations of these resources.

> Of course, the web server that serves the resources when asked might be a simple file server (as implied above) or an active component that generates them dynamically. Further, the publisher of the resources placed on the web can use capabilities like [CDNs] to distribute the resources. How the resources are posted at the required location is not defined by this spec; complying implementations need not support any HTTP methods other than GET.

> An active component might be used by the controller of the DID to automate the process of publishing and updating the DID document and [[ref: KERI event stream]] resources.

#### Read (Resolve)

Resolving a `did:webs` DID must follow these steps:
1. Convert the `did:webs` DID back to HTTPS URLs as described in section [Target System(s)](#target-systems).
1. Execute HTTP GET requests on both the URL for the DID document (ending in `/did.json`) and the URL for the [[ref: KERI event stream]] (ending in `/keri.cesr`).
1. Process the [[ref: KERI event stream]] using [KERI Rules] to verify it, then derive the `did:webs` [[ref: DID document]] by processing the [[ref: KERI event stream]] according to section [DID Document from KERI Events](#did-document-from-keri-events).
1. Transform the retrieved `did:web` DID document to the corresponding `did:webs` DID document according to section [Transformation to did:webs DID Document](#transformation-to-didwebs-did-document).
1. Verify that the derived `did:webs` DID document equals the transformed DID document.

> KERI-aware applications MAY use the [[ref: KERI event stream]] to make use of additional capabilities enabled by the use of KERI. Capabilities beyond the verification of the DID document and [[ref: KERI event stream]] are outside the scope of this specification.

#### Update

1. If the AID of the `did:webs` DID is updatable, updates MUST be made to the AID by adding KERI events to
the [[ref: KERI event stream]].
1. Updates to the [[ref: KERI event stream]] that relate to the `did:webs` DID MUST be reflected in the DID Document as soon as possible.
    1. If the `did:webs` DID files are statically hosted then they MUST be republished to the web server, overwriting the existing files.

#### Deactivate

1. To deactivate a `did:webs` DID, A controller SHOULD execute a KERI event that has the effect of rotating the key(s) to null and continue to publish the DID document and [[ref: KERI event stream]].
    1. Once the deactivation events have been applied, the controller should regenerate the DID document from the [[ref: KERI event stream]] and republish both documents (did.json and keri.cesr) to the web server, overwriting the existing files.
    1. A controller SHOULD NOT remove the DID folder and files from the web server on which it has been published. This is considered to be a bad approach, as those resolving the DID will not be able to determine if the web service is offline or the DID has been deactivated.
